ATESA: Aimless Transition Ensemble Sampling and Analysis
=========================================================

A Python program for automating transition path sampling with aimless shooting, suitable for experts and novices alike.

ATESA automates a particular Transition Path Sampling (TPS) workflow that uses the flexible-length aimless shooting algorithm of `Mullen et al. 2015 <http://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jctc.5b00032>`_. ATESA interacts directly with a batch system or job manager to dynamically submit, track, and interpret various simulation and analysis jobs based on one or more initial structures provided to it. The flexible-length implementation periodically checks simulations for commitment to user-defined reactant and product states in order to maximize the acceptance ratio and minimize wasted computational resources.

ATESA implements automation for obtaining a suitable initial transition state, flexible-length aimless shooting, inertial likelihood maximization, committor analysis, umbrella sampling (and analysis with the Multistate Bennett Acceptance Ratio), and equilibrium path sampling. These components constitute a near-complete automation of the workflow between identifying the reaction of interest, and obtaining, validating, and analyzing the energy profile along an unbiased and *bona fide* reaction coordinate that describes it.

ATESA has been published in the Journal of Chemical Theory and Computation, `here <http://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jctc.2c00543>`_. Please cite this paper in any work making use of any part of ATESA.
